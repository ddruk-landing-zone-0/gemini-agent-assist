        "The BondBasis factor significantly contributed to the overall performance, driving the highest net profit/loss. Currency performance was strong across multiple portfolios, with GBP in the European CEEMAEA Portfolio and USD in the LATAM Emerging Portfolio being key drivers. LATAM emerged as a high-performing business unit (BUIS), consistently appearing among both the top profit-generating and bottom loss-incurring units, suggesting a high degree of volatility or diverse trading strategies within the region.\n\nPortfolio performance was robust, with the American London CEEMAEA Portfolio generating +\u20ac391.7m, the European CEEMAEA Portfolio +\u20ac346.1m and the LATAM Emerging Portfolio +\u20ac379.5m. At the desk level, LATAM/NYC DSK and US/LDN DSK consistently appeared as both top performers and bottom performers, indicating a concentration of both high-yield and high-risk activities within these desks.\n\nAverage net profit/loss across currencies was consistently above +\u20ac1m, with INR showing a slightly higher average of +\u20ac1.047m. In terms of factors influencing profit/loss, BondBasis led with +\u20ac200.3m, followed by CreditSpread at +\u20ac204.4m, IRGamma at +\u20ac193m, FXDelta at +\u20ac171m and IRDelta at +\u20ac164.3m. The American London CEEMEA Portfolio appeared in the bottom 5 portfolios with the lowest net profit/loss, suggesting potential areas for review and optimization within that portfolio's strategies.\n",
        "The average Net Profit/Loss (NET) across all business units is approximately \u20ac1.01 million. CEEMEA and LATAM business units reported a PROF_LOSS of \u20ac0.\n\nCurrency performance varied: INR led with an average NET of \u20ac1.047 million, followed by GBP (\u20ac1.046 million) and EUR (\u20ac1.040 million). BRL lagged, averaging \u20ac0.903 million. USD also performed lower with \u20ac0.970 million.\n\nAmong portfolios, the \"American London CEEMEA Portfolio\" showed the highest average NET at \u20ac1.065 million, while the \"European CEEMEA Portfolio\" averaged \u20ac0.946 million.\n\nDesk performance showed \"EU/LDN DSK\" with an average NET of \u20ac0.986 million, \"LATAM/NYC DSK\" at \u20ac1.022 million, and \"US/LDN DSK\" at \u20ac1.034 million. The \"EU/LDN DSK\" desk exhibited the highest variance in NET.\n\nAnalysis of contributing factors reveals that Theta contributes the most to the total profit/loss variance. BondBasis has the highest frequency of losses. The ratio of profitable to loss-making transactions is highest for IRGamma (1.02), while FXDelta has a lower ratio (0.875)\n\nThe currency with the highest total profit is USD.\n"
