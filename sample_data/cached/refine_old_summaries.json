        "Equities performance reached +€3m, a 75% decrease compared to the previous year, primarily due to increased hedging losses this month. Strategy performance varied, with North America contributing +€4m, Energy +€2m, while Emerging Markets and Risk Management detracted -€2m and -€3m respectively. New Deals generated +€18m, driven by North America (+€8m), Emerging Markets (+€5m), Commodities (+€3m), Europe (+€1m), and APAC (+€1m). However, New Deals are down 25% compared to the previous year due to lower volatility trading during the holiday season and reduced liquidity, influenced by lower inflation expectations and the ECB maintaining a dovish stance. The RFQ conversion rate improved to 11.5% from 9.2% YoY, despite a 22% decrease in absolute client requests (28k CY vs 36K PY) and a 9% reduction in absolute hits (2.5K CY vs 3.5K PY), indicating lower client participation. Institutional Client Group (ICG) RCs contributed +€10m and Commercial Banking (CB) RCs +€4m, but are down 29% overall YoY due to subdued trading activity and lighter desk staffing. Hedging losses amounted to €(10)m, mainly from Equity Volatility -€6m due to short S&P 500 positions as the index rose 3%, and short Oil, GBP, and CAD positions. Vega contributed -€5m driven by Delta Neutral exposure, with the desk short Brent Crude and vols marked up on short-term contracts, and long EURGBP, USDCHF, and AUDJPY with vols marked down, primarily on mid-term tenors; IPV Bid-Offer was +€2m. Theta generated +€2m, driven by structured option trades across major indices (S&P, DAX, Nikkei) in a low vol regime and smaller risk positions, contrasting with a Theta bleed of -€9m in the previous year. Portfolio Reserves decreased by €(4)m, driven by Vega Bid-Offer adjustments, Long-Term FX Joint Ventures, and a reduction in proprietary positions. Contingent Risk remained stable, with new trades on USDCAD and EURCHF booking upfront gains, and an exercised GBPJPY trade contributing +€0.6m.\n",
        "Equities revenue reached +€29 million, a 21% increase year-over-year (YoY), driven by strong institutional flows and improved hedging strategies. Strategy performance was led by North America (+€16 million) and Emerging Markets (+€9 million), with additional contributions from Europe (+€3 million), APAC (+€2 million), and Risk Management (+€1 million). New Deals (ND) generated +€24 million, primarily from North America (+€13 million), Emerging Markets (+€8 million), and APAC (+€3 million); however, ND revenue declined by 38% YoY due to reduced speculative positioning and lower liquidity, influenced by shifting central bank policies reducing expectations of aggressive rate hikes. Request for Quote (RFQ) conversion rate declined to 13.1% from 14.3% YoY, with absolute client requests down 18% (30k CY vs 37k PY) and absolute hits down 20% (4.2k CY vs 5.3k PY). ICG RCs contributed +€12 million and CB RCs +€7 million, a 49% overall decrease YoY due to lighter trading and reduced client engagement. Hedging revenue was +€2 million, comprising +€6 million in Vega gains from Delta Neutral exposures with short positions on Brent, US T-Bonds, and USDNOK, offset by lower marked vols, and +€5 million in Delta gains from long USD, JPY, and EUR positions as the Dollar Index appreciated (+2.3%), partially offset by -€7 million in Gamma losses from long USD, GBP, and CAD positions. VPI reserve was -€3 million, linked to structured derivatives and corporate hedging books. Theta contributed +€5 million, driven by structured option trades across major indices (S&P, Nikkei, FTSE) and EM pairs (BRL, ZAR), a significant improvement from -€12 million PY, which included -€8 million from JPY Theta due to BoJ-driven volatility shifts. Contingent Risk generated +€4 million, primarily from +€3 million in New Deals (net of reserves), mainly from two exercised trades on USDCHF (+€2 million) and EURCAD (+€1 million).\n",
        "The financial report highlights strong performance across multiple asset classes. Futures revenue increased by €15 million compared to the prior year, which had losses due to B&H (Buy and Hold) positions impacted by rate hike expectations, with the Desk holding EUR and GBP positions; new deals contributed +€16 million from EUR & USD interest rate futures and various cross-currency swaps, with a slight volume increase compared to November; B&H positions resulted in a loss of €3 million, but the Futures Desk maintained minimal exposure with historically low VAR utilization; Theta losses amounted to €5 million across G10 pairs; Portfolio reserves increased by €3 million, driven by a €3 million Gamma Bid-Offer release, offset by €1 million in Treasury charges. Spot revenue increased by €30 million, up 2% compared to the prior year; Workflow contributed +€15 million, with new deals driven by FX Hedging Desk (+€7 million, including €5 million from two large corporate hedges), Equity PB (+€5 million), and Institutional Execution Services (+€3 million); Spot E generated +€8 million, with new deals of +€10 million in EURUSD, USDJPY, and AUDNZD, offset by a €1 million B&H loss and €1 million in Miscellaneous losses from Emerging Markets exposure and Contra Revenue; Spot Voice contributed +€5 million, with new deals of +€6 million across GBPUSD, USDCHF, EURJPY, and G10 Spot transactions; Emerging Markets Desk generated +€3 million from new deals across Latam and Asian currencies.

Central costs amounted to €(5) million, including Direct/Indirect Risk Charges (€4 million) and Clearing & Settlement Fees (€1 million), with Indirect Risk Charges increasing by €(3) million compared to the prior month due to a Treasury model update linked to short-term collateral buffer requirements."
